    This tool is specifically used to control the position movement of the service spacecraft, 
    corresponding to the actual satellite's thruster control system.
    All changes are increments relative to the current position.
    
    Coordinate system definition (spacecraft body coordinate system):
    - X-axis: Forward direction is positive (+dx), backward is negative (-dx)
    - Y-axis: Right direction is positive (+dy), left is negative (-dy)  
    - Z-axis: Downward direction is positive (+dz), upward is negative (-dz)
    
    üéØ CRITICAL MOVEMENT DECISION EXAMPLES:
    If target is at relative position (x=20.18m, y=0.00m, z=5.29m):
    - Target is 20.18m FORWARD and 5.29m BELOW
    - To approach target: set_position(dx=+2.0, dy=0, dz=+1.0)  # Move forward and down
    - To move away: set_position(dx=-2.0, dy=0, dz=-1.0)  # Move backward and up
    
    Common scenarios:
    - Target ahead and above (x>0, z<0): dx>0, dz<0 (forward, up)
    - Target ahead and below (x>0, z>0): dx>0, dz>0 (forward, down) 
    - Target behind and below (x<0, z>0): dx<0, dz>0 (backward, down)
    - Target on right side (y>0): dy>0 (move right)
    - Target on left side (y<0): dy<0 (move left)
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è PARAMETER VERIFICATION:
    Before calling, ask yourself:
    - Am I moving in the CORRECT direction toward the target?
    - If target is at x=+20m, should dx be positive? YES!
    - If target is at z=+5m, should dz be positive? YES!
    
    Args:
        dx: X-direction position change, unit: meters, positive for forward, negative for backward
        dy: Y-direction position change, unit: meters, positive for right, negative for left
        dz: Z-direction position change, unit: meters, positive for down, negative for up

    """Control spacecraft attitude change (rotation control)
    
    This tool is specifically used to control the attitude adjustment of the service spacecraft, 
    corresponding to the actual satellite's reaction wheel/gyroscope control system.
    All changes are increments relative to the current attitude.
    
    Attitude changes (Euler angles, in degrees):
    - dpitch: Pitch angle change, nose up is positive (+), nose down is negative (-)
    - droll: Roll angle change, right roll is positive (+), left roll is negative (-)
    - dyaw: Yaw angle change, right turn is positive (+), left turn is negative (-)
    
    üî• Important: Relationship between attitude control and coordinate system (Z-axis downward is positive)
    Target recovery strategy:
    - If target at z < 0 (target above spacecraft) ‚Üí need to pitch up ‚Üí dpitch > 0 ‚úÖ
    - If target at z > 0 (target below spacecraft) ‚Üí need to pitch down ‚Üí dpitch < 0 ‚úÖ
    - If target at y < 0 (target on left side) ‚Üí need to turn left ‚Üí dyaw < 0 ‚úÖ
    - If target at y > 0 (target on right side) ‚Üí need to turn right ‚Üí dyaw > 0 ‚úÖ
    
    Remember: z=-1.8m means target is above, need to pitch up (dpitch > 0)!
    
    üéØ CONCRETE ATTITUDE CONTROL EXAMPLES:
    If target is at relative position (x=20.18m, y=0.00m, z=5.29m):

    - Action: set_attitude(dpitch=-10, droll=0, dyaw=0)  # Pitch down to look at target
    
    If target is at relative position (x=15.0m, y=-3.0m, z=-2.0m):
    - Target is ABOVE (z=-2.0m) and LEFT (y=-3.0m)
    - Action: set_attitude(dpitch=+8, droll=0, dyaw=-12)  # Look up and turn left
    
    Common attitude adjustments:
    - Target above (z<0): dpitch>0 (pitch up, nose up)
    - Target below (z>0): dpitch<0 (pitch down, nose down)
    - Target left (y<0): dyaw<0 (turn left)
    - Target right (y>0): dyaw>0 (turn right)
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è ATTITUDE VERIFICATION:
    Before calling, verify your logic:
    - If target z=+5.29m (below), should I pitch down? YES! (dpitch<0)
    - If target y=-3.0m (left), should I turn left? YES! (dyaw<0)
    - If target z=-1.8m (above), should I pitch up? YES! (dpitch>0)
